/**
 * Reminders for warranties HO rejected and nobody has fixed.
 *
 * A rejected warranty is a dead end unless someone corrects and resubmits it.
 * Most never are — the customer sees one rejection message and forgets, and the
 * store has no list of what it owes. This chases both, on a schedule the admin
 * controls.
 *
 * Two rules decide who is chased, and both matter more than they look:
 *
 *  1. HO rejections only (`rejected_by = 'admin'`). A dealer who rejected an
 *     installation themselves must never receive "please correct this", and the
 *     customer must never be told the company refused something their own
 *     dealer declined. Rows whose origin could not be established are left
 *     NULL by the migration; whether those are chased is the admin's call
 *     (`includeUnclassified`).
 *
 *  2. Skip anything already resubmitted. A correction lands in
 *     `warranty_resubmissions` as `pending_review` and the original row *stays*
 *     `rejected`, so the obvious query would keep chasing the people who
 *     already did what was asked.
